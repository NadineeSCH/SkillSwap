SKILLSWAP APP : exchange skills, build communities
This POC is built using android studio (Java + XML). 

//features//
Skill matching feature where users can match with each other in terms of skills they want to learn and skills they can teach. This will then be displayed as cards in the matches view.

//Some decisions and reasonings//
1. I considered using open source libraries such as Fuse.js, but then opted for a native matching logic instead for better control and debuggability
2. I chose to have a dummy data rather than setting up a whole database for rapid prototyping purposes
